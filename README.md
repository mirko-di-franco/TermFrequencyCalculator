# Term Frequency Calculator
This Java project implements a simple system to calculate the term frequency (TF) in a text document. Term frequency calculation is one of the fundamental techniques used by search engines like Google to rank search results. When a user enters a query, Google analyzes documents in its index and calculates the frequency of the query terms in each document.

## Features
- Counts the number of occurrences of a specific term in a document.
- Calculates the frequency of a term relative to the total number of words in the document.

## Code Structure
The project includes the following main methods:
1. **`getFrequencyCount(String term, String doc)`** this method calculates the number of occurrences of a specific term (**`term`**) within a document (**`doc`**).
2. **`termFrequency(String term, String doc)`** this method calculates the term frequency (TF) of a specific term within a document.
